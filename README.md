# Countdown Numbers Game

# Introduction

### What is the application?

This application is a version of the TV show Countdown's number round. It replicates the structure of the show by having a target number which needs to be match by performing arithmetic operations on 6 numbers that are randomly choosen.

### What does the application run on?

This application is built using Racket and will run on any machine or OS once it has Racket installed. 

### What libraries does the application use?

The application uses the standard Racket package and no imports are needed.

### How can the application be deployed?

The application can be downloaded as a zip folder or cloned from GitHub repository. If doing so, use the master branch as that will have the final working version of the program. The script to run is 

```
countdown.rkt
```

It is best to run this in the editor DrRacket. You can run it from the command line but this is **NOT** recommended as it can bring up errors that don't occur in DrRacket. If you still want to run it off the command line, you can navigate to the directory that the script is in and run the following command

```
racket countdown.rkt
```
